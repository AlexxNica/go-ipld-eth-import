`ETHEREUM CLIENT` ---> `IPFS`

Bag of hacks to get your ethereum information to IPFS.

## Overview

The best way to face this problem in an organically way, is to create simple
scripts that perform a simple task well. And then, use scripts to automatize
the tasks and control the flow.

There are three categories of programs in this repository:

* Extractors: Take data _from_ and ethereum source (mostly the Parity IPFS or RPC APIs).
* Feeders: Insert data _into_ IPFS, using some invocation of `ipfs dag put`.
* Control: Scripts to automate these processes ("_Get me the txs of the latests 100 blocks_").
